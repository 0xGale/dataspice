The goal of `dataspice` is to make it easier for researchers to create basic, lightweight and concise metadata files for their datasets. These basic files can then be used to:

 -   make useful information available during analysis.
 -   create a helpful dataset README webpage.
 -   produce more complex metadata formats to aid dataset discovery.

Metadata fields are based on schema.org and other metadata standards.

`create_spice()` takes the users data file(s) and creates a set of template metadata files.

- attributes
  Three columns 
    fileName
    name
    uniText
    Description

- access

- biblio

- creators

Which the user will then populate with appropriate information.

Then the populated metadata files are fed into `write_JSON()` which converts those tabular metadata files into json. 

Then `build_function()` is used to convert the JSON code into a website that clearly communicates the metadata in an interactive form.
