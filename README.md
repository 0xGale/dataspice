dataspice
=========

The goal of dataspice is to make it easier for researchers to create basic, lightweight and concise metadata files for their datasets. These basic files can then be used to:

-   make useful information available during analysis.
-   create a helpful dataset README webpage.
-   produce more complex metadata formats to aid dataset discovery.

Metadata fields are based on [schema.org](http://schema.org/Dataset) and other metadata standards.

Installation
------------

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/dataspice")
```

Example
-------

Generate metadata in 3 lines of code!

``` r
create_spice()
write_spice() 
build_site()
```

This diagram shows an example workflow to create metadata for data files.

### Create spice

-   `create_spice()` creates template metadata spreadsheets in a folder (by default created in the `data` folder)

The template files are:

-   **attributes.csv** - explains each of the variables in the dataset
-   **biblio.csv** - for spatial and temporal coverage, dataset name, keywords, etc.
-   **access.csv** - for files and file types
-   **creators.csv** - for data authors

### Fill in templates

The user needs to fill in the details of the 4 template files. These csv files can be directly modified, or they can be edited using some helper functions and/or a shiny app.

-   `prep_attributes()` populates the **fileName** and **variableName** columns of the attributes.csv file using the header row of the data files.

-   `editAttritubes()` opens a shiny app that can be used to edit `attributes.csv`. The shiny app dispalys the attributes table and lets the user fill in an informative description and units (e.g. meters, hectares, etc.) for each variable.

### Save json-ld file

-   `write_spice()` generates a json-ld file

### Build website

-   `build_site()` generates an index.html file in the repository `docs` folder, so if the repository has the github pages setting turned on then it will create a website that shows a simple view of the dataset with the metadata and an interactive map.
